If you run WordPress as a CMS or if your site consists primarily of Pages, you might want your blog to look quite different from your site.

== Description ==

With this plugin you can set a **base name** for your blog pages. For example: www.yoursite.com/**blog**/name-of-my-post , where "blog" is the base for your blog pages. If the plugin detects the base name in the URL, it switches the theme to a completely different theme which you can select.

Similarly, in the WP Admin, while adding a new post, the theme is switched to the blog theme and it shows the blog theme's options instead of the default theme's options.

*Read the installation instructions carefully before using!*

== Installation ==

1. Upload 'junaidbhura-switch-blog-theme' to the '/wp-content/plugins/' directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Navigate to Settings -> Switch Blog Theme Options and make sure you add all options. This plugin won't work unless all three options are added
4. Make sure that the base for the blogs matches your permalink structure by navigating to Settings -> Permalinks and under "Custom Structure" you have something like *blog/%post-name%/* (refer screenshot 2)
